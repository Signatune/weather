# Vanilla JS Web App Template

This repo serves as a starting template for web development projects for my work
following the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) free curriculum

## What's Inside

Currently this template is configured to use several tools and technologies
that I have found useful for efficient development. They are:

- Webpack
- ESLint (Configured to use the [AirBNB Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Prettier
- Babel (using babel-loader and @babel/preset-env)
